I'm up with the sunshine

I lace up my high-tops (oh,no!)
Slam dunk,

show me what you got
I'm under the spotlight (holler)
I dare you,
come on and follow
You dance to your own beat I'll
sing the melody!
When you say,
"Yeah,
" I say,
"No.
" When you say,
"Stop,
" all
I wanna do is go, go, go!
You (you) –the other half of me
The half I'll never be The half
that drives me crazy!
You–thebetter half of me The
half I'll
always need! We both know We're
better in stereo!
B, b-better in stereo Oh, oh, oh

When you say,
"Yeah,
